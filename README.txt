I implemented this project using SQL and Java Swing.


The project simulates a grocery store software. The owner of the store is able to keep a record of items he/she has for sale, his/her clients as well as all the transactions made. Items are stored into the database by category, which can be edited or deleted from the system throughout their lifecycle in the store. The owner can use the system to purchase a new item from a client or to search specific items and clients by name.
